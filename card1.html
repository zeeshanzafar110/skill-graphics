    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Logo & how many Types of logo</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">There are seven types of logos we bring you latest brief about all seven types of logos.</br>
        Hope you will enjoy these information about logos.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>What is a logo Just understand that it is the form of any brand When you wake up in the morning, numerous logo designs are in front of you as you pick up a mobile, so the company logo is present on this mobile. When you go to the washroom and do every toothpaste, the logo of this brand is in front of you. A brand of soap comes out that has a logo on it too Similarly, people start to see you all day, at the beginning of the day And they have become so entrenched in our lives that we don’t even notice what they are But by looking at the logo of this brand we can recognize that this is the logo of the Famous company This logo has been going on since ancient times, people were not so well-educated. There are many brands in the market such as Coca-Cola Pepsi and many but it doesn’t take long to become famous overnight.<br>
        Today we tell you how many types of logo There are about seven types of logos Which is the first one that comes (emblems)</p>
          <h2>First Type of Logo</h2>
          <p>It’s a very old type of logo that’s been around for a long time This kind of logo started to emerge when people started branding when we make a show we have a very old culture.<br>
            Your company has been around for a long time and if you want to show that culture (emblems) is the right kind But one problem is that they cannot be used in very small sizes If you have to use an icon in a website like this, you cannot use it.</p>
            <h2>Second type of logos is (word marks).</h2>
            <p>That is, it’s just a name like Google, Coca-Cola Visa company Use it when your name is very unique and short, so it is very useful to you. The fonts are used with a lot of thought Monogram is third type used when your company name is too big then you pick up its words and make it a logo. Such as (HBO and NASA) etc. Smaller Type (Pictorial Mark) Such as an Apple company Such a company does not do so from the beginning, but first it comes up with the name, then when it becomes very famous, then after that it is only (Pictorial Mark).</p>

            <p>The fifth type is (abstracted logo mark) This is the most favorite type of logo that people like You will find many such logos There is a feeling of joy in this (abstraction) The sixth type of logo we have (mascot) It’s the kind of character that highlights your brand The seventh type we have is the combination mark It all matches up to the ones you’ve already seen By combining them with all the varieties seen above, we make this happen Combination Mark This is one of the most successful things Just like our own company logo is similar, when a logo becomes popular, you can remove any of it.</p>

            <p>We hope you enjoy this little quote about the logo we will continue to offer these types of blocks to your service in the future as our company is a design and print firm we provide this service for companies. Along with that, we have now started a series of blogs. We hope you will like our new series if you have any suggestions and will definitely give our little effort to our friends. Thank you so that they too can benefit.</p>
